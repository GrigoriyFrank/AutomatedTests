Story: The selected product must be added to the shopping cart

As a user
In order to keep track of selected products
I want to add selected products to shopping cart

Scenario 1: The number of selected products must be visible on Products page
Given that Products page is opened
When I selected 3 products from product list
Then I should see that statuses of selected products changed
And the number of selected products is on Product page

Scenario 2: The selected products must be visible on Your Cart page
Given that Products page is opened
When I selected 3 products from product list
And I opened Your Cart page
Then I should see that selected products are in the list on Your Cart page

Scenario 3: The order of products on Your Cart page must be the same as they were selected on Product page
Given that Products page is opened
When I selected the first product from product list
And I selected the third product from product list
And I selected the fifth product from product list
And I opened Your Cart page
Then I should see that selected products are in order they were selected on Product page
