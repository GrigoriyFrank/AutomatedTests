Story: The selected product must be added to the shopping cart

As a user
In order to keep track of selected products
I want to add selected products to shopping cart

Scenario 1: The number of selected products must be visible on Products page
Given that Products page is opened
When I select 3 products from product list
Then I should see the number of selected products on Product Page

Scenario 2: The selected products must be visible on Your Cart page
Given that Products page is opened
When I select 3 products from product list
And I open Your Cart page
Then I should see that selected products are in the list on Your Cart page
