Story: sorting feature on Products page

As a user
In order to show products for user in different order
I want to check sorting feature

Scenario 1: Check default type of sorting
Given that Products page is opened
Then I should see that 'Name (A to Z)' type of sorting is visible
And the order of products is alphabetical by titles

Scenario 2: Check the list of exist types of sorting
Given that Products page is opened
When I chose type of sorting
Then I should see next types of sorting: Name (A to Z), Name (Z to A), Price (low to high), Price (high to low)

Scenario 3: Check 'Name (Z to A)' type of sorting
Given that Products page is opened
When I choose 'Name (Z to A)' type of sorting
Then I should see that the order of products is reverse alphabetical by titles

Scenario 4: Check 'Price (low to high)' type of sorting
Given that Products page is opened
When I choose 'Price (low to high)' type of sorting
Then I should see that the order of products is ascending by prices

Scenario 5: Check 'Price (high to low)' type of sorting
Given that Products page is opened
When I choose 'Price (high to low)' type of sorting
Then I should see that the order of products is descending by prices
