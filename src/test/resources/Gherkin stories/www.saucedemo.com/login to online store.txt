Story: Login to online store

//TODO: add cases for login with empty fields
As a user
In order to login to online store
I want to check login to online store with valid, locked and invalid user

Scenario 1: Login to online store with valid user
Given that www.saucedemo.com login page is opened
When I login with valid user
Then I should be redirected to Products page

Scenario 2: Login to online store with locked user
Given that www.saucedemo.com login page is opened
When I login with locked user
Then I should stay on Login page
And I should see message Epic sadface: Sorry, this user has been locked out. on Login page

Scenario 3: Login to online store with invalid user
Given that www.saucedemo.com login page is opened
When I login with invalid user
Then I should stay on Login page
And I should see message Epic sadface: Username and password do not match any user in this service on Login page
