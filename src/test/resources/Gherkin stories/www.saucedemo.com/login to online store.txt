Story: Login to online store

As a user
In order to login to online store
I want to check login to online store with valid, locked and invalid user

Scenario 1: Login to online store with valid user
Given that www.saucedemo.com login page is opened
When I type standard_user in Username field
And I type secret_sauce in Password field
And I click LOGIN button 
Then I should be redirected to Products page

Scenario 2: Login to online store with locked user
Given that www.saucedemo.com login page is opened
When I type locked_out_user in Username field
And I type secret_sauce in Password field
And I click LOGIN button
Then I should stay on Login page
And I should see message Epic sadface: Sorry, this user has been locked out. below LOGIN button
